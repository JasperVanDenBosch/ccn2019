              traditionally thought to propagate serially along a bottom-up
              hierarchy of ventral areas. Recent proposals gradually promote
              the role of top-down processing in recognition, but how such
              facilitation is triggered remains a puzzle. We tested a specific
              model, proposing that low spatial frequencies facilitate visual
              object recognition by initiating top-down processes projected
              from orbitofrontal to visual cortex. The present study combined
              magnetoencephalography, which has superior temporal resolution,
              functional magnetic resonance imaging, and a behavioral task that
              yields successful recognition with stimulus repetitions. Object
              recognition elicited differential activity that developed in the
              left orbitofrontal cortex 50 ms earlier than it did in
              recognition-related areas in the temporal cortex. This early
              orbitofrontal activity was directly modulated by the presence of
              low spatial frequencies in the image. Taken together, the
              dynamics we revealed provide strong support for the proposal of
              how top-down facilitation of object recognition is initiated, and
              our observations are used to derive predictions for future

              GLMdenoise, estimates of spatially correlated noise (which may be
              physiological, instrumental, motion-related, or neural in origin)
              are derived from the data and incorporated as nuisance regressors
              in a general linear model (GLM) analysis. We previously showed
              that GLMdenoise outperforms a variety of other denoising
              techniques in terms of cross-validation accuracy of GLM estimates
              (Kay et al., 2013a). However, the practical impact of denoising
              for experimental studies remains unclear. Here we examine whether
              and to what extent GLMdenoise improves sensitivity in the context
              of multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data. On a large number
              of participants (31 participants across 4 experiments; 3 T,
              gradient-echo, spatial resolution 2-3.75 mm, temporal resolution
              1.3-2 s, number of conditions 32-75), we perform representational
              similarity analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008a) as well as
              pattern classification (Haxby et al., 2001). We find that

              and never degrades performance for individual participants and
              that GLMdenoise also improves across-participant consistency. We

              or condition. In many circumstances, measuring this signal of
              interest is limited by noise. In this study, we present
              GLMdenoise, a technique that improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
              by entering noise regressors into a general linear model (GLM)
              analysis of fMRI data. The noise regressors are derived by
              conducting an initial model fit to determine voxels unrelated to
              the experimental paradigm, performing principal components
              analysis (PCA) on the time-series of these voxels, and using
              cross-validation to select the optimal number of principal
              components to use as noise regressors. Due to the use of data
              resampling, GLMdenoise requires and is best suited for datasets
              involving multiple runs (where conditions repeat across runs). We

              Benchmark (DNB), a public database and architecture for

              described in this paper, a code framework that enables automatic
              evaluation of a denoising method, and implementations of several
              denoising methods, including GLMdenoise, the use of motion
              parameters as noise regressors, ICA-based denoising, and

               magnetic resonance imaging to scan a unique group of adults who,

              relative contribution of perceptual and conceptual information to
              object recognition? Here, we examined this question by designing
              a face familiarization protocol during which participants were
              either exposed to rich perceptual information (viewing each face
              in different angles and illuminations) or with conceptual
              information (associating each face with a different name). Both
              conditions were compared with single-view faces presented with no
              labels. Recognition was tested on new images of the same
              identities to assess whether learning generated a view-invariant
              representation. Results showed better recognition of novel images
              of the learned identities following association of a face with a
              name label, but no enhancement following exposure to multiple
              face views. Whereas these findings may be consistent with the
              role of category learning in object recognition, face recognition
              was better for labeled faces only when faces were associated with
              person-related labels (name, occupation), but not with
              person-unrelated labels (object names or symbols). These findings
              suggest that association of meaningful conceptual information
              with an image shifts its representation from an image-based
              percept to a view-invariant concept. They further indicate that
              the role of conceptual information should be considered to
              account for the superior recognition that we have for familiar

              is much easier than identifying unfamiliar faces, and that this
              familiar face advantage persists across a range of tasks.
              However, attempts to understand face familiarity have mostly used
              a binary contrast between 'familiar' and 'unfamiliar' faces, with
              no attempt to incorporate the vast range of familiarity we all
              experience. From family members to casual acquaintances and from
              personal to media exposure, familiarity is a more complex
              categorisation than is usually acknowledged. Here we model levels
              of familiarity using a generic statistical analysis (PCA combined
              with LDA) computed over some four thousand naturally occurring
              images that include a large variation in the numbers of images
              for each known person. Using a strong test of performance with
              entirely novel, untrained everyday images, we show that such a
              model can simulate widely documented effects of familiarity in
              face recognition and face matching, and offers a natural account
              of the internal feature advantage for familiar faces.
              Furthermore, as with human viewers, the benefits of familiarity
              seem to accrue from being able to extract consistent information
              across different photos of the same face. We argue that face
              familiarity is best understood as reflecting increasingly robust
              statistical descriptions of idiosyncratic within-person
              variability. Understanding how faces become familiar appears to
              rely on both bottom-up statistical image descriptions (modelled
              here with PCA), and top-down processes that cohere superficially
              different images of the same person (modelled here with LDA).",

              high-level representation of objects at the interface between
              vision and semantics. This suggests that the perceived similarity
              of real-world objects might be predicted from the IT
              representation. Here we show that objects that elicit similar
              activity patterns in human IT (hIT) tend to be judged as similar
              by humans. The IT representation explained the human judgments
              better than early visual cortex, other ventral-stream regions,
              and a range of computational models. Human similarity judgments
              exhibited category clusters that reflected several categorical
              divisions that are prevalent in the IT representation of both
              human and monkey, including the animate/inanimate and the
              face/body division. Human judgments also reflected the
              within-category representation of IT. However, the judgments
              transcended the IT representation in that they introduced
              additional categorical divisions. In particular, human judgments
              emphasized human-related additional divisions between human and
              non-human animals and between man-made and natural objects. hIT
              was more similar to monkey IT than to human judgments. One

              faces and bodies because these divisions are fundamental to
              survival and reproduction for all primate species, and that other

              organizes them into categories. Recent studies using pattern
              analyses methods have characterized a representational space of

              object exemplars are discriminable and cluster according to
              category (e.g., faces and bodies). In the present study we
              examined how category structure in object representations emerges
              in the first 1000 ms of visual processing. In the study,
              participants viewed 24 object exemplars with a planned
              categorical structure comprised of four levels ranging from
              highly specific (individual exemplars) to highly abstract
              (animate vs. inanimate), while their brain activity was recorded
              with magnetoencephalography (MEG). We used a sliding time window

              category that participants were viewing on a moment-to-moment
              basis. We found exemplar and category membership could be decoded
              from the neuromagnetic recordings shortly after stimulus onset
              (<100 ms) with peak decodability following thereafter. Latencies
              for peak decodability varied systematically with the level of
              category abstraction with more abstract categories emerging
              later, indicating that the brain hierarchically constructs
              category representations. In addition, we examined the

              object category information and show these patterns vary over

              familiarity on various kinds of visual face judgments, yet the
              role of familiarity in face processing is not fully understood.
              Across different face judgments and stimulus sets, the data is
              equivocal as to whether or not familiarity impacts recognition
              processes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we examine the
              effect of real-world personal familiarity in three simple
              delayed-match-to-sample tasks in which subjects were required to
              match faces on the basis of orientation (upright v. inverted),
              gender and identity. We find that subjects had a significant
              speed advantage with familiar faces in all three tasks, with
              large effects for the gender and identity matching tasks.
              CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicates that real-world
              experience with a face exerts a powerful influence on face
              processing in tasks where identity information is irrelevant,
              even in tasks that could in principle be solved via low-level

               contributed by different voxels (or neurons). Condition-rich
               designs more richly sample the stimulus space and can treat each
               stimulus as a unique entity. Finally, each individual's brain is
               unique and recent studies have found ways to model and analyse
               the interindividual representational variability. Here we review
               our field's journey towards more sophisticated analyses that
               honour these important idiosyncrasies of brain representations.
               We describe an emerging framework for investigating individually
               unique pattern representations of particular stimuli in the
               brain. The framework models stimuli, responses and individuals
               multivariately and relates representations by means of
               representational dissimilarity matrices. Important components
               are computational models and multivariate descriptions of brain
               and behavioural responses. These recent developments promise a
               new paradigm for studying the individually unique brain at
               unprecedented levels of representational detail.",

              performing fMRI scanning during a recognition memory test for
              faces that were unfamiliar, famous, or personally known. The
              presence of pre-experimental knowledge of a face was incidental
              to the task, but nonetheless resulted in improved performance.
              Two distinct networks of activation were associated with correct
              recollection of a face's prior presentation (recollection hits
              vs. correct rejections) on one hand, and with pre-experimental
              knowledge about it (famous or personally known vs. unfamiliar
              faces) on the other. The former included mid/posterior cingulate
              cortex, precuneus, and ventral striatum. The latter included
              bilateral hippocampus, retrosplenial, and ventromedial prefrontal
              cortices. Anterior and medial thalamic activations showed an
              interaction between both effects, driven by increased activation
              for recollection of unfamiliar faces. When recollecting the

              either from focal lesions or neurodegenerative disease (e.g.,
              semantic dementia), impairs perception as well as long-term
              declarative memory. Notably, however, these two patient groups
              show different performance for meaningful versus unfamiliar
              stimuli. In amnesics with nonprogressive MTL lesions, the use of
              meaningful stimuli, compared with unfamiliar items, boosted
              discrimination performance. In semantic dementia, a condition
              characterized by progressive deterioration of conceptual
              knowledge in the context of anterolateral temporal lobe damage,
              performance for meaningful stimuli was equivalent to that for
              unfamiliar items. To further investigate these findings, we
              scanned healthy volunteers while they performed odd-one-out
              discriminations involving familiar (i.e., meaningful/famous) and
              unfamiliar (i.e., novel) objects and faces and a baseline task of
              size oddity. Outside the scanner, volunteers' recognition memory
              was assessed. We found above baseline activity in the perirhinal
              cortex and hippocampus for all object and face discriminations
              and above baseline activity in the temporal pole for all face
              discriminations. The comparison of meaningful, relative to novel,

              Importantly, these meaningfulness effects were evident even for
              discriminations that were not subsequently well remembered,
              suggesting that the difference between meaningful and novel
              stimuli reflects perceptual or conceptual processes rather than
              solely incidental encoding into long-term memory. The results
              provide further evidence that the MTL is recruited during complex
              perceptual discrimination and additionally suggest that these

              Interestingly, these two patient groups showed different profiles
              of impairment for familiar and unfamiliar stimuli. For MTL
              amnesics, the use of familiar relative to unfamiliar stimuli
              improved discrimination performance. By contrast, patients with
              semantic dementia-a neurodegenerative condition associated with
              anterolateral temporal lobe damage-showed no such facilitation
              from familiar stimuli. Given that the two patient groups had

              addressed this question with a multivariate reanalysis of the

              analyses revealed that functional connectivity of the right

              the degree of stimulus familiarity. For familiar relative to

              that in order to benefit from stimulus familiarity, it is
              necessary to engage not only the perirhinal cortex and

               object recognition were explored in human visual cortex by using
               the technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Here we
               report evidence for object-related activation. Such activation
               was located at the lateral-posterior aspect of the occipital
               lobe, just abutting the posterior aspect of the motion-sensitive
               area MT/V5, in a region termed the lateral occipital complex
               (LO). LO showed preferential activation to images of objects,
               compared to a wide range of texture patterns. This activation
               was not caused by a global difference in the Fourier spatial
               frequency content of objects versus texture images, since object
               images produced enhanced LO activation compared to textures
               matched in power spectra but randomized in phase. The
               preferential activation to objects also could not be explained
               by different patterns of eye movements: similar levels of
               activation were observed when subjects fixated on the objects
               and when they scanned the objects with their eyes. Additional
               manipulations such as spatial frequency filtering and a 4-fold
               change in visual size did not affect LO activation. These
               results suggest that the enhanced responses to objects were not
               a manifestation of low-level visual processing. A striking
               demonstration that activity in LO is uniquely correlated to
               object detectability was produced by the ``Lincoln'' illusion,
               in which blurring of objects digitized into large blocks
               paradoxically increases their recognizability. Such blurring led
               to significant enhancement of LO activation. Despite the
               preferential activation to objects, LO did not seem to be
               involved in the final, ``semantic,'' stages of the recognition
               process. Thus, objects varying widely in their recognizability
               (e.g., famous faces, common objects, and unfamiliar
               three-dimensional abstract sculptures) activated it to a similar
               degree. These results are thus evidence for an intermediate link

               the ages of eighteen and ninety years and including 342 mono-
               and dizygotic twins. Data on each subject includes detailed
               demographic, clinical, behavioural and imaging information. DNA
               has been collected for genotyping from 5800 subjects. A

               the probabilistic distribution of microscopic cyto- and

  author    = "Misaki, Masaya and Kim, Youn and Bandettini, Peter A and
               Kriegeskorte, Nikolaus",
  abstract  = "A popular method for investigating whether stimulus information
               is present in fMRI response patterns is to attempt to ``decode''
               the stimuli from the response patterns with a multivariate
               classifier. The sensitivity for detecting the information
               depends on the particular classifier used. However, little is
               known about the relative performance of different classifiers on
               fMRI data. Here we compared six multivariate classifiers and
               investigated how the response-amplitude estimate used (beta- or
               t-value) and different pattern normalizations affect
               classification performance. The compared classifiers were a
               pattern-correlation classifier, a k-nearest-neighbors
               classifier, Fisher's linear discriminant, Gaussian na{\"\i}ve
               Bayes, and linear and nonlinear (radial-basis-function kernel)
               support vector machines. We compared these classifiers' accuracy
               at decoding the category of visual objects from response
               patterns in human early visual and inferior temporal cortex
               acquired in an event-related design with BOLD fMRI at 3T using
               SENSE and isotropic voxels of about 2-mm width. Overall,
               Fisher's linear discriminant (with an optimal-shrinkage
               covariance estimator) and the linear support vector machine
               performed best. The pattern-correlation classifier often
               performed similarly as those two classifiers. The nonlinear
               classifiers never performed better and sometimes significantly
               worse than the linear classifiers, suggesting overfitting.
               Defining response patterns by t-values (or in
               error-standard-deviation units) rather than by beta estimates
               (in \% signal change) to define the patterns appeared
               advantageous. Cross-validation by a leave-one-stimulus-pair-out
               method gave higher accuracies than a leave-one-run-out method,
               suggesting that generalization to independent runs (which more
               safely ensures independence of the test set) is more challenging
               than generalization to novel stimuli within the same category.
               Independent selection of fewer more visually responsive voxels
               tended to yield better decoding performance for all classifiers.
               Normalizing mean and standard deviation of the response patterns
               either across stimuli or across voxels had no significant effect
               on decoding performance. Overall our results suggest that linear
               decoders based on t-value patterns may perform best in the
               present scenario of visual object representations measured for
               about 60min per subject with 3T fMRI.",

               measure the weak electromagnetic signals generated by neuronal
               activity in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and
               locate neural activation in the brain is a challenge that
               requires expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics,
               and numerical methods. As part of the MNE software suite,
               MNE-Python is an open-source software package that addresses
               this challenge by providing state-of-the-art algorithms
               implemented in Python that cover multiple methods of data
               preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and
               estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain
               regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in
               a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling
               users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python
               scripts. Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the
               core Python libraries for scientific comptutation (NumPy, SciPy)
               and visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the
               greater neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel
               package. The code is provided under the new BSD license allowing
               code reuse, even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has
               only been under heavy development for a couple of years, it has
               rapidly evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and
               pedagogical tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated
               during code development to help share best practices. MNE-Python
               also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users
               to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of
               methods by other researchers. Full documentation, including
               dozens of examples, is available at http://martinos.org/mne.",
