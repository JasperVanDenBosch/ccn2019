  abstract = "Investigations of the neural correlates of face recognition have
              typically used old/new paradigms where subjects learn to
              recognize new faces or identify famous faces. Familiar faces,
              however, include one's own face, partner's and parents' faces.
              Using event-related fMRI, we examined the neural correlates of
              these personally familiar faces. Ten participants were presented
              with photographs of own, partner, parents, famous and unfamiliar
              faces and responded to a distinct target. Whole brain, two
              regions of interest (fusiform gyrus and cingulate gyrus), and
              multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Compared with
              baseline, all familiar faces activated the fusiform gyrus; own
              faces also activated occipital regions and the precuneus; partner
              faces activated similar areas, but in addition, the
              parahippocampal gyrus, middle superior temporal gyri and middle
              frontal gyrus. Compared with unfamiliar faces, only personally
              familiar faces activated the cingulate gyrus and the extent of
              activation varied with face category. Partner faces also
              activated the insula, amygdala and thalamus. Regions of interest
              analyses and laterality indices showed anatomical distinctions of
              processing the personally familiar faces within the fusiform and
              cingulate gyri. Famous faces were right lateralized whereas
              personally familiar faces, particularly partner and own faces,
              elicited bilateral activations. Regression analyses show
              experiential predictors modulated with neural activity related to
              own and partner faces. Thus, personally familiar faces activated
              the core visual areas and extended frontal regions, related to
              semantic and person knowledge and the extent and areas of
              activation varied with face type.",

              measure the time course of neural responses to faces, thereby
              addressing two fundamental questions about how face processing
              unfolds over time. First, using representational similarity

              before identity information, suggesting a coarse-to-fine
              processing of face dimensions. Second, identity and gender
              representations of familiar faces were enhanced very early on,

              upon a program in 1992 to develop a four-dimensional
              probabilistic atlas and reference system for the human brain.
              Through an International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) a
              dataset is being collected that includes 7000 subjects between
              the ages of eighteen and ninety years and including 342 mono- and
              dizygotic twins. Data on each subject includes detailed
              demographic, clinical, behavioural and imaging information. DNA
              has been collected for genotyping from 5800 subjects. A component
              of the programme uses post-mortem tissue to determine the
              probabilistic distribution of microscopic cyto- and
              chemoarchitectural regions in the human brain. This, combined
              with macroscopic information about structure and function derived
              from subjects in vivo, provides the first large scale opportunity
              to gain meaningful insights into the concordance or discordance
              in micro- and macroscopic structure and function. The philosophy,
              strategy, algorithm development, data acquisition techniques and
              validation methods are described in this report along with
              database structures. Examples of results are described for the
              normal adult human brain as well as examples in patients with
              Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The ability to

              correlations in humans to take place in a population this large.
              This approach and its application should provide new insights and

  author   = "Barense, Morgan D and Henson, Richard N A and Graham, Kim S",
  abstract = "Recent studies indicate that medial-temporal lobe (MTL) damage,
              either from focal lesions or neurodegenerative disease (e.g.,
              semantic dementia), impairs perception as well as long-term
              declarative memory. Notably, however, these two patient groups
              show different performance for meaningful versus unfamiliar
              stimuli. In amnesics with nonprogressive MTL lesions, the use of
              meaningful stimuli, compared with unfamiliar items, boosted
              discrimination performance. In semantic dementia, a condition
              characterized by progressive deterioration of conceptual
              knowledge in the context of anterolateral temporal lobe damage,
              performance for meaningful stimuli was equivalent to that for
              unfamiliar items. To further investigate these findings, we
              scanned healthy volunteers while they performed odd-one-out
              discriminations involving familiar (i.e., meaningful/famous) and
              unfamiliar (i.e., novel) objects and faces and a baseline task of
              size oddity. Outside the scanner, volunteers' recognition memory
              was assessed. We found above baseline activity in the perirhinal
              cortex and hippocampus for all object and face discriminations
              and above baseline activity in the temporal pole for all face
              discriminations. The comparison of meaningful, relative to novel,
              faces and objects, revealed increased activity in the perirhinal
              cortex and hippocampus. In the temporal pole, we also found
              activity related to meaningfulness for faces but not for objects.
              Importantly, these meaningfulness effects were evident even for
              discriminations that were not subsequently well remembered,
              suggesting that the difference between meaningful and novel
              stimuli reflects perceptual or conceptual processes rather than
              solely incidental encoding into long-term memory. The results
              provide further evidence that the MTL is recruited during complex
              perceptual discrimination and additionally suggest that these
              structures are recruited in semantic processing of objects and

              GLMdenoise, estimates of spatially correlated noise (which may be
              physiological, instrumental, motion-related, or neural in origin)
              are derived from the data and incorporated as nuisance regressors
              in a general linear model (GLM) analysis. We previously showed
              that GLMdenoise outperforms a variety of other denoising
              techniques in terms of cross-validation accuracy of GLM estimates
              (Kay et al., 2013a). However, the practical impact of denoising
              for experimental studies remains unclear. Here we examine whether
              and to what extent GLMdenoise improves sensitivity in the context
              of multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data. On a large number
              of participants (31 participants across 4 experiments; 3 T,
              gradient-echo, spatial resolution 2-3.75 mm, temporal resolution
              1.3-2 s, number of conditions 32-75), we perform representational
              similarity analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008a) as well as
              pattern classification (Haxby et al., 2001). We find that
              GLMdenoise substantially improves replicability of
              representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) across independent
              splits of each participant's dataset (average RDM replicability
              increases from r = 0.46 to r = 0.61). Additionally, we find that
              GLMdenoise substantially improves pairwise classification
              accuracy (average classification accuracy increases from 79\%
              correct to 84\% correct). We show that GLMdenoise often improves
              and never degrades performance for individual participants and
              that GLMdenoise also improves across-participant consistency. We
              conclude that GLMdenoise is a useful tool that can be routinely
              used to maximize the amount of information extracted from fMRI

              rich contextual support for episodic recollection of a recent
              event. We examined the neural bases of these two processes by
              performing fMRI scanning during a recognition memory test for
              faces that were unfamiliar, famous, or personally known. The
              presence of pre-experimental knowledge of a face was incidental
              to the task, but nonetheless resulted in improved performance.
              Two distinct networks of activation were associated with correct
              recollection of a face's prior presentation (recollection hits
              vs. correct rejections) on one hand, and with pre-experimental
              knowledge about it (famous or personally known vs. unfamiliar
              faces) on the other. The former included mid/posterior cingulate
              cortex, precuneus, and ventral striatum. The latter included
              bilateral hippocampus, retrosplenial, and ventromedial prefrontal
              cortices. Anterior and medial thalamic activations showed an
              interaction between both effects, driven by increased activation
              for recollection of unfamiliar faces. When recollecting the
              presentation of a famous or personally known face, hippocampal
              activation increased with participants' ratings of how well they
              felt they knew the person shown. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex
              showed significantly greater activation for personally known than
              famous faces. Our results indicate a dissociation between the
              involvement of retrosplenial vs. mid/posterior cingulate and
              precuneus in memory tasks. They also indicate that, during
              recognition memory experiments, the hippocampus supports
              incidental retrieval of pre-experimental knowledge about the
              stimuli presented. This type of knowledge likely underlies the
              additional recollection found for prior presentation of well
              known stimuli compared with novel ones and may link hippocampal
              activation at encoding to subsequent memory performance more

              has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of
              thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and
              diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive
              study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used
              to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no
              widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data
              collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and
              reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible
              and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic
              pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem,
              we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a
              standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS
              standard uses file formats compatible with existing software,
              unifies the majority of practices already common in the field,
              and captures the metadata necessary for most common data

              cognitive recognition processes, were equal to those of famous
              faces. Activation of stored structural representations of

              the N250r component in event-related brain potentials. Face
              recognition unit activation increased from unfamiliar over famous
              to personally familiar faces, suggesting that there are stronger
              representations for personally familiar than for famous faces.
              Because the topographies of the N250r for personally and famous

  abstract = "Recent research suggests that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is
              involved in perception as well as in declarative memory. Amnesic
              patients with focal MTL lesions and semantic dementia patients
              showed perceptual deficits when discriminating faces and objects.
              Interestingly, these two patient groups showed different profiles
              of impairment for familiar and unfamiliar stimuli. For MTL
              amnesics, the use of familiar relative to unfamiliar stimuli
              improved discrimination performance. By contrast, patients with
              semantic dementia-a neurodegenerative condition associated with
              anterolateral temporal lobe damage-showed no such facilitation
              from familiar stimuli. Given that the two patient groups had
              highly overlapping patterns of damage to the perirhinal cortex,
              hippocampus, and temporal pole, the neuroanatomical substrates
              underlying their performance discrepancy were unclear. Here, we
              addressed this question with a multivariate reanalysis of the
              data presented by Barense et al. (2011), using functional
              connectivity to examine how stimulus familiarity affected the
              broader networks with which the perirhinal cortex, hippocampus,
              and temporal poles interact. In this study, healthy participants
              were scanned while they performed an odd-one-out perceptual task
              involving familiar and novel faces or objects. Seed-based
              analyses revealed that functional connectivity of the right
              perirhinal cortex and right anterior hippocampus was modulated by
              the degree of stimulus familiarity. For familiar relative to
              unfamiliar faces and objects, both right perirhinal cortex and
              right anterior hippocampus showed enhanced functional
              correlations with anterior/lateral temporal cortex, temporal
              pole, and medial/lateral parietal cortex. These findings suggest
              that in order to benefit from stimulus familiarity, it is
              necessary to engage not only the perirhinal cortex and
              hippocampus, but also a network of regions known to represent
              semantic information.",

  abstract = "Primate inferior temporal (IT) cortex is thought to contain a
              high-level representation of objects at the interface between
              vision and semantics. This suggests that the perceived similarity
              of real-world objects might be predicted from the IT
              representation. Here we show that objects that elicit similar
              activity patterns in human IT (hIT) tend to be judged as similar
              by humans. The IT representation explained the human judgments
              better than early visual cortex, other ventral-stream regions,
              and a range of computational models. Human similarity judgments
              exhibited category clusters that reflected several categorical
              divisions that are prevalent in the IT representation of both
              human and monkey, including the animate/inanimate and the
              face/body division. Human judgments also reflected the
              within-category representation of IT. However, the judgments
              transcended the IT representation in that they introduced
              additional categorical divisions. In particular, human judgments
              emphasized human-related additional divisions between human and
              non-human animals and between man-made and natural objects. hIT
              was more similar to monkey IT than to human judgments. One
              interpretation is that IT has evolved visual-feature detectors
              that distinguish between animates and inanimates and between
              faces and bodies because these divisions are fundamental to
              survival and reproduction for all primate species, and that other
              brain systems serve to more flexibly introduce species-dependent
              and evolutionarily more recent divisions.",
